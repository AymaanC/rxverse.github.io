		<h1>What can we learn from light curves?</h1>
		<p>Astronomers can better comprehend the mechanisms at play within the object they are investigating and pinpoint particular categories (or classes) of stellar events by using the record of brightness fluctuations that a light curve gives. When we plot a new light curve, we may compare it to those standard light curves to perhaps determine the type of object we're viewing. We know roughly what light curves look like for a set of things. We would recognize the item as an eclipsing double star if the light curve we measured resembled the graph below. We can also see from the light curve that it takes 10 days for one star in the double to complete one orbit of the other. The orbital period of the binary system, according to astronomers, is 10 days.</p>

		<p>The light curve we recorded would have revealed that this object was the result of a star dying from a supernova if it had instead resembled the one below!</p>

		<h1>Classical Novae and Dwarf Novae</h1>
		<p>In the middle of the 19th century, optical astronomers discovered CVs based on their outbursts. According to the characteristics of the outbursts, CVs are divided into two subclasses: classical novae and dwarf novae. One eruption of a classical nova is observed, and it has the highest amplitude of any CV. The abrupt nuclear fusion of hydrogen-rich material on the surface of the white dwarf is what causes classical nova outbursts. Since white dwarfs are the remains of stars like the Sun, hydrogen fusion can only occur when new fuel is deposited on the surface of the white dwarf.</p>

		<h1>X-ray Emission from CVs</h1>
		<p>Uhuru discovered some X-ray sources that later turned out to be CVs; the Einstein observatory discovered that many CVs were weak X-ray sources. This is not unexpected given that the stuff that is accreting can readily reach temperatures of around 100 million degrees close to the white dwarf surface. Therefore, research on CVs in X-rays reveals the specifics of the accretion process close to the primary. The majority of CVs use an accretion disk to carry out the process of accretion. This happens because accretion cannot proceed in a straight line since the material exiting the secondary has angular momentum from the binary motion. Instead, a disk-like shape develops in the binary orbit's plane (i.e., an accretion disk). The accreting material heats up because to friction within the disk, which causes it to eventually spiral down onto the white dwarf surface. The boundary layer, which is located just above the white dwarf's surface, is thought to be the primary source of the X-rays in these CVs. Where the gas in the disk is compelled to move at the same speed as the white dwarf's rotation is shown by this boundary layer.</p>

		<p>An area of the sky as seen by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is depicted in this animation. There are multiple visual abnormalities that arise and vanish in the various frames, and some of the stars in this movie are variable stars that seem to alter in brightness over time (these are not variable sources).</p>
		<div class="empty"></div>
		<p>The hunt for extraterrestrial life must take into account the inherent uncertainties in the methods employed to find them, particularly in light of the recent debate regarding the statistical importance of planet discoveries. Take Kepler, a 1.4 m space telescope operated by NASA, which will spend at least 3.5 years observing 100,000 stars. It searches for transiting exoplanets, which if they chance to pass in front of our line of sight, block a portion of the light from their home star. By keeping an eye out for minute dips in the light curve (the brightness of the star over time), we can spot these transits and deduce the characteristics of the planet. Would it affect our ability to find a planet if the star dims for some other cause, though?</p>
		<p>Since Kepler was created in part to research stellar variability, it is well known that some types of stars periodically expand and vary in temperature, which results in fluctuations in brightness and color. The most well-known examples of stellar variability are enormous in scale and very simple to separate from a planet's mark, but certain stars, like the Sun, show more subtle shifts that make it far more difficult to find planets.</p>
		<p>The authors examine the possibility of finding Earth if we were to see a twin of our solar system from a distance of 10 pc (1 parsec = 3.26 lightyears). They discuss the effects of star spots and plages on astrometric detection operations in this paper, the third in their series.</p>
		<p>Spots are regions of the star photosphere that are black and cold (the surface where most of the light we see comes from). High vertical magnetic field line concentrations are associated with their creation. Similar locations with bright Halpha emission can be seen in the chromosphere as plages and network structures (right above the photosphere). Spots and plages can resemble the periodic effects of circling planets because they frequently occur on a time scale of years.</p>
		<p>The exoplanet finding method used by astrometry is an alternative to Kepler's transit method. Astrometry examines variations in apparent position as the star and its planets orbit a shared center of mass (or "wobble" in the sky) rather than changes in brightness. The brightness of the star is plainly impacted by (dark) spots and (bright) plages, but they also have an impact on the star's apparent location by altering the stellar disk's position-weighted brightness distribution.</p>
		<p>The authors mimic solar system data using more than ten years' worth of satellite measurements, which include 1.8 million solar plages and network topologies and 21,000 solar sunspot groups. They discover that the Sun's astrometric fluctuation during this time was roughly five times lower than the Earth's astrometric signature. The scientists point out that radial velocity measurements, which rely on the Doppler shift of a star's spectrum as it orbits the center of mass, are another method for finding exoplanets and are more susceptible to the noise produced by solar plages and spots. In light of this, they are in favor of astrometry's application in looking for Earth-mass planets in the habitable regions of active Sun-like stars.</p>
